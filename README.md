# nfl_twitter_prediction

This repository contains the code written for my senior Capstone project at Montana Tech (STAT 499).
Owner: Sarah Wiseman
Co-owner: Jace Rhodes

The project uses tweets from NFL games (2020-2022 seasons) and applies sentiment analysis to the tweets on a positive-negative scale.
The tweets, along with weekly team stats, will be used to train a model that can predict which team will win in any given matchup on any given week.

More details to come.
